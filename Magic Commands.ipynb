    "\n",
    "Magic commands in Jupyter Notebook are special commands that start with the `%` symbol (line magic) or `%%` symbol (cell magic) and are used to perform various tasks such as running shell commands, measuring execution time, or changing the behavior of the notebook. Here are some commonly used magic commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   `%run` - Runs a Python script in a new notebook cell.\n",
    "-   `%time` - Measures the execution time of a single statement.\n",
    "-   `%timeit` - Measures the execution time of a statement multiple times and returns the average execution time.\n",
    "-   `%debug` - Activates the interactive debugger.\n",
    "-   `%load` - Loads the contents of a file into a cell.\n",
    "-   `%matplotlib inline` - Displays plots in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a magic command, simply type it into a code cell in a Jupyter Notebook and run the cell. Note that magic commands only work in Jupyter Notebook and not in standard Python scripts or the Python REPL. You can also use the `?` character to get help on a particular magic command. For example, `%time?` will display the documentation for the `%time` command."
